The ``cbp`` package provides code for the LSST `collimated beam projector <https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05867>`_ (CBP).
The primary objects of interest are:

`lsst.cbp.CoordinateConverter`: compute the telescope and CBP pointing that will give you a desired beam arrangement, such as placing beam *b* at point *p* on the pupil and point *d* on a specified detector.

`lsst.cbp.computeHolePositions`: compute hole positions for a CBP mask.

To construct an `lsst.cbp.CoordinateConverter` you will need to learn about configuration:

.. toctree::

    configuration

In order to :ref:`configure <lsst.cbp.configuration>` and use an `lsst.cbp.CoordinateConverter` it may help to have some understanding of the coordinate systems involved:

    coordinateFrames
