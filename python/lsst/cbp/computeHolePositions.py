def computeHolePositions(detectorNames, detectorPositions, cameraGeom, cbpFlipX, cbpFocalLength):
    """Compute hole positions for a CBP mask.

    Given the desired locations of one or more spots on each detector,
    and assuming the telescope and CBP are pointing directly at each other,
    compute hole positions for a CBP mask.

    Parameters
    ----------
    detectorNames : `iterable` of `str`, or None,
        List of detector names; if None, use all detectors
        in ``cameraGeom``.
    detectorPositions : `iterable` of pair of `float`
        Detector x, y positions (pixels).
        Note that the center of a 1kx1k detector is (499.5, 499.5)
    cameraGeom : `lsst.afw.cameraGeom.Camera`
        Camera geometry.
    cbpFlipX : `bool`
        Is the CBP focal plane flipped?

    Returns
    -------
    holePositions : `list` of `tuple` of pair of `float`
        CBP mask x, y hole positions mm.

    Notes
    -----
    This code assumes that all detectors have approximately the same
    dimensions and orientation. This restriction should suffice for LSST
    because the two kinds of CCDs it uses have very similar dimensions.
    However, it will not do for HSC because that has very rectangular
    CCDs and some are 90 degrees from the others.
